## ⚙️ Installation

To install the **Knowledge Database Management Service**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/knowledge-database-management-service.git
   cd knowledge-database-management-service
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use `pip` to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

To start the service, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the Knowledge Database Management Service, which you can interact with via the defined APIs or CLI.

## 🔗 Integration

To integrate the **Knowledge Database Management Service** into your existing project, you can install the module and call its functions directly from the `view` package or other modules as needed.

1. **Install the Module**:

   Install the service as a package:

   ```bash
   pip install -e /path/to/knowledge-database-management-service
   ```

2. **Import and Use Functions in Your Code**:

   Once installed, you can import and use the functions provided by the service. For example, to use a function from the `view` module:

   ```python
   from knowledge_db_management.view import view_function_name

   # Example usage
   result = view_function_name(parameters)
   print(result)
   ```

   Replace `view_function_name` with the actual function you wish to use, and `parameters` with the appropriate arguments.

By integrating this module, you can leverage its knowledge management capabilities, version control, and enhanced CRUD operations directly within your application.

## 🔧 Configuration

The service uses a YAML configuration file located at `storage/config/main_config.yaml`. You can modify this file to change the application's settings, such as database connections, logging levels, and other parameters.

## 🧪 Running Tests

To run the test suite, use:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

This will execute all the test cases in the tests directory and provide a report of the test results.
